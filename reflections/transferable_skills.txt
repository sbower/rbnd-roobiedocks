As Technical Lead for Cornellâ€™s Cloudification team I am responsible for developing strategy
for moving campus applications to the cloud. I lead a small team that partners with campus units
to achieve that goal. In my daily work I use technologies like Docker, Puppet, Loggly and Jenkins.

In order to maximize our move to the cloud we are embracing elasticity. This requires
us to be proficient in the AWS API to EC2, ELB, VPC, Route53, S3, EBS and RDS. We take
advantage of metered billing and spot instances to help optimize cost.

As part of this role I work closely with the university security office to make
sure our move to cloud meets our security standards. I help create policy for VPC
Setup and design including basic networking, setting up NACLs, setting up security
groups and securing resources using MFA.

Transferable skills
1) Previous development experience in ruby
2) Experience with managing and maintaining complex systems.
